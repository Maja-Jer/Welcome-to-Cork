            <div class= "container english-market-description">
                <p col= "english-market-description"> There has been a market on the present site since 1788 but the present group of buildings was 
                constructed in the mid-19th century with the ornamental entrance at Princes Street being constructed in 1862 by Sir John Benson. 
                The market changed little over the next century or so until it was seriously damaged by fire on 19 June 1980 and had to be 
                extensively refurbished by Cork City Council. The refurbishment work was done in sympathy with the original Victorian building's 
                design and won a Gold Medal from the Europa Nostra heritage foundation for conservation shortly after its completion.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Since its refurbishment the market has become more multicultural, and a variety of fresh produce from around the world can be 
                bought there. The market is still best known however for its fresh fish and butchers, and it serves many of the city's top 
                restaurants. It is a source of local specialities such as drisheen, spiced beef, and buttered eggs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I love coming to the English market on Saturdays because there is a lot of people coming for the fresh produce to cook the 
                following week, the smell of freshly-baked bread is felt in every corner of the market making want to dive into those freshly 
                baked baguettes with just a hint of salted butter on them.</p>

                <p col="fota-decription">Fota Wildlife Park, part of the Zoological Society of Ireland, is located on 100 acres at Fota Island 10km 
                east of Cork City and has an annual attendance of 440,000 visitors. It is currently the second largest visitor attraction in Ireland 
                outside of Leinster.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Fota Wildlife Park’s vision is to inspire people to understand and conserve the biodiversity of our natural world. The Park’s 
                core values of conservation, education, research and entertainment have ensured that we are uniquely placed to foster greater public 
                understanding of the threats to plant and animal habitats and decreasing global biodiversity. Fota Wildlife Park has made 
                considerable investment in the past 5 years upgrading its infrastructure and is currently near completion of an additional 27 acres 
                development that focuses on Asian animals and plants.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My favourite part of Fota is just strolling around and seeing the animals up close, seeing them interact in an environment that is 
                similar to their natural habitat. Just majestic!</p>

                <p col="triskel-decription">Housed in an old church, this state of the art venue which launched in 2011 is programmed with a rich 
                bill of live music with a focus on Classical and Jazz concerts, cultural cinema, visual art exhibitions and literary events. Triskel 
                runs a second contemporary art room Triskel Gallery Space. Unique in Ireland, the Theatre Development Centre is the only full time 
                operation dedicated to the development of theatre, which is managed by Corcadorca Theatre Company.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>Cork Traveller Women’s Network relocated their Headquarters to Triskel in 2018. Scrypt Café Bar is an atmospheric casual 
                dining and coffee space with a great brunch and lunch menu and a tapas style evening offering.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Just that feeling of watching an artsy film in an old church is extraordinary, something to experience at least once during your visit to Cork</p>

            <div class= "container blarney-description">
                <p col= "blarney-decription">For over 200 years, world statesmen, literary giants, 
                and legends of the silver screen have joined the millions of pilgrims climbing the 
                steps to kiss the Blarney Stone and gain the gift of eloquence. Its powers are 
                unquestioned but its story still creates debate.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Once upon a time, visitors had to be held by the ankles and lowered head first 
                over the battlements. Today, we are rather more cautious of the safety of our 
                visitors. The Stone itself is still set in the wall below the battlements. To 
                kiss it, one has to lean backwards (holding on to an iron railing) from the 
                parapet walk. The prize is a real one as once kissed the stone bestows the gift 
                of eloquence.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The ground of the Blarney Castle are spectacular, no matter what time of the 
                year, with my personal favourite being autumn, when all the leaves start changing 
                colours is a thousand shades of yellow, orange and red. A sight to behold!</p>
                <br>
                <p>To kiss the Blarney Stone one has to walk up to the top of the castle, usually 
                wait in a queue and lie down upside down and kiss a stone. If you do that you will 
                get the “gift of gab”</p>
