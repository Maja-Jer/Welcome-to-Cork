  # H1 Welcome to Cork!
  
  Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
  
  As someone who has recently moved to Cork, Ireland I have found it difficult to find information on 
  different aspects of the city. The information could be found on multiple websites and often it would be
  hidden in sections that are not connected to the topic. A lot of time was spent looking for information
  that would have been better to be found in one place
  
  
  This project is meant to be a catch-all for tourists (for a start)
  and is intended to grow by adding information for potential new members of the growing population
  of expats who have chosen to call Cork their new home. I will write about that below.
  
  The webpage is meant to be text-heavy as the main point of a page like this is to convey infromation to people coming to visit Cork.
  I have used this page as inpsiration for the structure of my page: https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/cork-irl-co-cork.htm

  # H2 UX
  
  My goal was to design a website that has a clear distribution of information, with a layout that 
  is easy to follow and isn't overwhelming the with a lot of photos. The blue theme was used to add minimalist touc
  to the page.
  
  I have divided the site in 3 sections
  HOME (WELCOME TO CORK) houses some general information about Cork, starting from the number of inhabitants to the 
  companies that are employing a large number of expats and famous Corkonians.
  
  SEE as the name suggests, showcases my personal favorites among the Cork sites. I have used some information
  from different online sources (linked below) and added my own personal suggestions and tips about each of them.
  
  EXPERIENCE It is said that the most vivid memories are made through personal experiences and taht is the reason why 
  I chose to write about my personal favourites, the ones that have made an impression on me and I wanted to showcase them on this page.
  
  # H2 TECHNOLOGIES
  
  1. HTML
  2. CSS
  3. BOOTSTRAP 4.3.1
  
  # H2 FEATURES

  I have used Bootstrap to add the Navbar and media queries but I have adapted them to fit my needs. After writing index.html header and footer, I duplicated that page to use as a template for the other 2 pages. 
  Also when I got the layout of see.html to what I wanted it to be, I have duplicated it and used as a template for 
  the structure of experience.html.
  
  # H3 Features Left to Implement
  
  In the future, i would like to add some more sections to the page that would help out potential new residents of the city 
  in navigating the bureocracy connected to moving to a new country.
  
  Also, I would like to expand the offer on the page to places to eat, stay and go out. In the ideal situation, I'd add 
  an option to potental book restaurants through the page, find short-term accommodation for tourists and a webshop with merchandise
  and items that I would to be useful and connected to the general theme of the website.
  
  # H2 TESTING
  
  The page was tested across multiple devices (iPhone 7, Huawei P30 Pro, Huawei P30 Lite, Samsung S9, MacbookAir, MacbookPro, ChromeBox, Windows laptops), 
  operating systems (Android, Chrome OS, iOS, Windows 10) and browsers (Chrome 77.0.3865.120, Safari 13.0.2., Mozilla 70.0)
