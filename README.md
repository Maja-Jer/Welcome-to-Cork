  Welcome to Cork!
  
  I designed this website having tourists in mind. 
  I wanted to give a personal view on Cork's attractions and experiences
  A list of my favourite places in Cork is in here
  
  I have taken some basic information from various Wikipedia pages:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)
  - 
  
  but then I have added my personal reccommandations for each of those places, what I like most about each of them
  
  
  
  Code-wise, I have used Bootstrap and adapted the codes I got there to what I wanted to do with the page.

The webpage is meant to be text-heavy as the main point of a page like this is to convey infromation to people coming to visit Cork.
I have used this page as inpsiration for the structure of my page: https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/cork-irl-co-cork.htm

The photos I used were from different webistes and I have linked the websites in each of the photos
