                <p col= "ucc-description">With over 20 000 people studying or working in University College Cork, the draw of the studies there is clear. But when you walk on to the Campus, it’s as if time stopped and you were transported back in time Despite much growth and development
            in recent decades, including considerable ongoing structural developments on the main campus, none of the developments have cast a shadow on the beautiful open grass quadrangle (which, incidentally, undergraduates must not traverse because
            tradition declares that they will fail their exams if they do). The quadrangle is surrounded on three sides by the University's most important old stone buildings, including the stone corridor housing many Ogham stones, and the arch where
            students anxiously come to view their end of year examination results. The stunning Aula Maxima is just off the stone corridor. With some luck you might get to see the statue of Queen Victoria, erected to commemorate Victoria's 1849 visit,
            which is in a locked room (again off the stone corridor). The statue stood on the eastern gable of the Aula Maxima from 1849 until 1934, when it was replaced by a statue of St Finbarr - after which it was buried (for its own protection) in
            the President's garden. It was finally dug up in 1994, but remains under lock and key. Don't miss the Honan Chapel, on campus, with its eleven impressive Harry Clarke stained glass windows
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The first time I visited the Campus I had a feeling I was walking through Hogwarts, there is this air of mystery in the older parts of the Campus that is captivating.</p>

                <p col="park-decription">Fitzgerald Park home to Cork Public Museum on the Mardyke is just a short distance from Cork City centre and 
        the University College Cork. Fitzgerald's Park where the visitor and local alike can enjoy a riverside on the banks of the river Lee. 
        Fitzgerald's Park named after a previous Lord Mayor of Cork in 1901, Edward Fitzgerald, offers a quite retreat from the hustle and bustle 
        of the city, with its beautiful tree lined avenues, brimming flower beds and rose garden to its many statues and sculptures and the large 
        central fountain, this 18 acre park is a wonderful treat. Fitzgerald's Park is a quiet haven, which has a playground for the children and a 
        cafe to enjoy the view of the river Lee and across to the gardens and houses of the Sunday's Well area.</p>
        <br>
                <p>The Park is home to numerous events with some of teh favourites being Summer Cinema and different family-oriented weekends. 
            My personal favourite is the weekend of African or Cuban culture with a lot of dance workshops which I enjoy thoroughly, being a dancer myself.</p>

                <p col="shandon-decription">Enjoy the Unique experience of Ringing the world famous Shandon Bells from the first floor. 
            Unwind and be at peace in the beautiful surrounds of St. Anne's Church - one of the oldest churches in the city built in 1722..
            The church is noted for its 8 bells due to the song "The Bells of Shandon" by Francis Sylvester Mahony. The largest weighs a little over 
            1.5 tons and was originally cast by Abel Rudhall of Gloucester. To reduce vibration, they were placed in a fixed position. They first 
            rang on December 7, 1752. They have been recast twice: in 1865 and 1906. Today, visitors can climb 132 stairs to the first floor and 
            ring the bells themselves. See spectacular 360 degree views of the city at 36.65m/120ft. View the internal workings of the clocks, the 
            ‘Four Faced Liar’ and see the 18th Century bells in the Belfry.</p> 
            <br>
                <p>When the bells ring, they can be heard in the surrounding neighbourhoods, the locals are so used to the sounds that it just disappers in the traffic noise.</p>

            <div class= "container blackrock-description">
                <p col= "blackrock-decription">In the late 16th century, the citizens of Cork appealed to Queen Elizabeth I to construct a fort at 
                Blackrock to "repel pirates and other invaders". In 1582 a fortification was built on the site,[6] and later around 1600, a round 
                tower was constructed to safeguard against pirates "carrying away" vessels entering the harbour.[7] The earliest elements of this 
                structure remaining today are a circular tower on the water's edge, 10.5m in diameter, with walls 2.2m thick.
                In the early-2000s, Blackrock Castle was redeveloped under a joint venture between Cork City Council, Cork Institute of Technology 
                and a private benefactor.</p>
            <br>
                <p>The castle has an excellent restaurant where you can have brunch in one of the most interesting surroundings in Cork. The Observatory 
            has a lot of interesting exhibits, my personal being the possibility to lie down under the night sky and just enjoy the view as the stars 
            shine above you. So relaxing!</p>
