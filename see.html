            <p>With over 20 000 people studying or working in University College Cork, the draw of the studies there is clear. But when you walk on to the Campus, itâ€™s as if time stopped and you were transported back in time Despite much growth and development
            in recent decades, including considerable ongoing structural developments on the main campus, none of the developments have cast a shadow on the beautiful open grass quadrangle (which, incidentally, undergraduates must not traverse because
            tradition declares that they will fail their exams if they do). The quadrangle is surrounded on three sides by the University's most important old stone buildings, including the stone corridor housing many Ogham stones, and the arch where
            students anxiously come to view their end of year examination results. The stunning Aula Maxima is just off the stone corridor. With some luck you might get to see the statue of Queen Victoria, erected to commemorate Victoria's 1849 visit,
            which is in a locked room (again off the stone corridor). The statue stood on the eastern gable of the Aula Maxima from 1849 until 1934, when it was replaced by a statue of St Finbarr - after which it was buried (for its own protection) in
            the President's garden. It was finally dug up in 1994, but remains under lock and key. Don't miss the Honan Chapel, on campus, with its eleven impressive Harry Clarke stained glass windows
