        <!--------------- About Cork -------->

        <div class="container-fluid" id="container-about-cork">
            Cork is the second largest city in the Republic of Ireland with a population of 210 000 inhabitants.
            <br>
            <p>Cork was the European Capital of Culture for 2005, and in 2009 was included in the Lonely Planet's top 10 "Best in Travel 2010". The guide described Cork as being "at the top of its game: sophisticated, vibrant and diverse".
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>There is a rivalry between Cork and Dublin, similar to the rivalry between Manchester and London, Melbourne and Sydney or Barcelona and Madrid. Some Corkonians view themselves as different from the rest of Ireland, and refer to themselves
                as "The Rebels"; the county is known as the Rebel County. This view sometimes manifests itself in humorous references to the Real Capital and the sale of T-shirts with light-hearted banners celebrating The People's Republic of Cork (Wikipedia)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Cork City is a hub of industry in the province. Several pharmaceutical companies have significant operations in the area, including Pfizer Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Swiss company Novartis. Perhaps the most famous product of the Cork pharmaceutical
                industry is Viagra. Cork is also the European headquarters of Apple Inc. where over 3,000 staff are involved in manufacturing, R&D and customer support. Logitech, Amazon and EMC Corporation are also important IT employers in the area.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The city is also home to the Heineken Brewery that brews Murphy's Irish Stout and the nearby Beamish and Crawford brewery (taken over by Heineken in 2008) which have been in the city for generations. 45% of the world's Tic Tac sweets are manufactured
                at the city's Ferrero factory. [wikipedia]
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of the famous Corkonians include: <br><strong>Jack Gleeson</strong> (Joffrey from Game of Thrones), <strong>Cillian Murphy</strong> (of Peaky Blinders fame), <strong>Jonathan Rys-Meyers</strong> (King Henry VII in Tudors), <strong>Roy Keane</strong>                (footballer)
            </p>
