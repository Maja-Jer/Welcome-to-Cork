But when you walk on to the Campus, it’s as if time stopped and you were transported back in time Despite much growth and development\n            in recent decades, including considerable ongoing structural developments on the main campus, none of the developments have cast a shadow on the beautiful open grass quadrangle (which, incidentally, undergraduates must not traverse because\n            tradition declares that they will fail their exams if they do). The quadrangle is surrounded on three sides by the University's most important old stone buildings, including the stone corridor housing many Ogham stones, and the arch where\n            students anxiously come to view their end of year examination results. The stunning Aula Maxima is just off the stone corridor. With some luck you might get to see the statue of Queen Victoria, erected to commemorate Victoria's 1849 visit,\n            which is in a locked room (again off the stone corridor). The statue stood on the eastern gable of the Aula Maxima from 1849 until 1934, when it was replaced by a statue of St Finbarr - after which it was buried (for its own protection) in\n            the President's garden. It was finally dug up in 1994, but remains under lock and key. Don't miss the Honan Chapel, on campus, with its eleven impressive Harry Clarke stained glass windows\n        </p>\n\n\n    </div>\n\n\n<div class= \"container fitzgerald-park\">\n            <div class= \"row fitzgerald-park\">\n                <div class= \"col-6\">\n                    <h3>Fitzgerald Park</h3>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            \n                \n        <img class= \"img-fluid\" src=\"./assets/photos/fitzgerald-park1.jpg\" alt=\"Fitzgerald Park \">\n        <br>\n        <h7><a href= \"http://www.corkenglishcollege.ie/media/4ae2bbd4-2834-4204-b7ae-c0ea07ad30a5/Events/Fitzgerald-Park_jpg \">Photo Source</a></h7>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <div class=\"container park-description\">\n        <p col=\"park-decription\">Fitzgerald Park home to Cork Public Museum on the Mardyke is just a short distance from Cork City centre and \n        the University College Cork. Fitzgerald's Park where the visitor and local alike can enjoy a riverside on the banks of the river Lee. \n        Fitzgerald's Park named after a previous Lord Mayor of Cork in 1901, Edward Fitzgerald, offers a quite retreat from the hustle and bustle \n        of the city, with its beautiful tree lined avenues, brimming flower beds and rose garden to its many statues and sculptures and the large \n        central fountain, this 18 acre park is a wonderful treat. Fitzgerald's Park is a quiet haven, which has a playground for the children and a \n        cafe to enjoy the view of the river Lee and across to the gardens and houses of the Sunday's Well area.\n\n        </p>\n\n\n    </div>\n\n\n<div class= \"container shandon-bells\">\n            <div class= \"row shandon-bells\">\n                <div class= \"col-6\">\n                    <h3>Shandon Bells</h3>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            \n                \n        <img class= \"img-fluid\" src=\"./assets/photos/shandon.jpg \" alt=\"Shandon Bells \">\n        <br>\n        <h7><a href=\"http://www.shandonbells.ie/uploads/1/2/6/6/12669090/1388908_orig.jpg\">Photo Source</a></h7>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <div class= \"container shandon-description\">\n        <p col=\"shandon-decription\">Enjoy the Unique experience of Ringing the world famous Shandon Bells from the first floor. \nUnwind and be at peace in the beautiful surrounds of St. Anne's Church - one of the oldest churches in the city built in 1722..﻿\nThe church is noted for its 8 bells due to the song \"The Bells of Shandon\" by Francis Sylvester Mahony. The largest weighs a little over 1.5 tons and was originally cast by Abel Rudhall of Gloucester. To reduce vibration, they were placed in a fixed position. They first rang on December 7, 1752. They have been recast twice: in 1865 and 1906. Today, visitors can climb 132 stairs to the first floor and ring the bells themselves. See spectacular 360 degree views of the city at 36.65m/120ft. View the internal workings of the clocks, the ‘Four Faced Liar’ and see the 18th Century bells in the Belfry. \n\n\n        </p>\n\n\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class= \"container blackrock-castle\">\n            <div class= \"row blackrock-castle\">\n                <div class= \"col-6\">\n                    <h3>Blackrock castle</h3>\n                </div>\n            </div> \n            \n                \n        <img class= \"img-fluid\"src=\"./assets/photos/blackrock-castle.jpg\" alt=\"Blackrock castle\">\n        <br>\n        <h7><a href= \"https://www.bco.ie/whats-here/dailyschedule/\">Photo Source</a></h7>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <div class= \"container blackrock-description\">\n        <p col= \"blackrock-decription\">In the late 16th century, the citizens of Cork appealed to Queen Elizabeth I to construct a fort at Blackrock to \"repel pirates and other invaders\". In 1582 a fortification was built on the site,[6] and later around 1600, a round tower was constructed to safeguard against pirates \"carrying away\" vessels entering the harbour.[7] The earliest elements of this structure remaining today are a circular tower on the water's edge, 10.5m in diameter, with walls 2.2m thick.\nIn the early-2000s, Blackrock Castle was redeveloped under a joint venture between Cork City Council, Cork Institute of Technology and a private benefactor.\n\nThe castle has an excellent restaurant where you can have brunch in one of the most interesting surroundings in Cork. The Observatory has a lot of interesting exhibits, my personal being the possibility to lie down under the night sky and just enjoy the view as the stars shine above you.
